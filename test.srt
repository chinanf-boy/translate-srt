1
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:12,520
Quite an Arctic storm blowing out there

2
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:15,320
Hm! Come along, Polly, my child, with my cloak

3
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:18,360
Doctor, you've got the most fantastic wardrobe.Yes

4
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:20,520
We don't know what we're in for outside there

5
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,560
Pretty soon we shall be having visitors

6
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:28,040
You're different. You've got no feelings

7
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:29,840
I do not understand that word

8
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:34,280
Emotions. Love, pride, hate, fear

9
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:37,920
Have you no emotions, sir?

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,520
What's happened to you, Doctor?

11
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,520
I guess this old body of mine is wearing a bit thin

12
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:50,640
Doctor! Wakey, wakey, it's all over now

13
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,760
No

14
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:00,520
It isn't all over

15
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:04,280
It's far from being all over

16
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:06,080
What are you talking about?

17
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:08,520
I must get back to the TARDIS

18
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:18,760
I can't go through with it. I will fight it

19
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,160
I will not change

20
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:24,600
Hello? Is someone there?

21
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,320
Hello?

22
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,400
Who is that?

23
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,400
I'm the Doctor

24
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:41,280
Oh, I don't think so. No, dear me, no

25
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:47,880
You may be A Doctor, but I am THE Doctor

26
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:50,840
The original, you might say

27
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,440
You!

28
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,840
How can it...be you?

29
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,280
Do I know you, sir?

30
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:05,120
This is the South Pole! We're at the South Pole!

31
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:07,600
Of course we are. Don't you know that?

32
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,880
This is where it happened

33
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,440
Where what happened?

34
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,840
This is it...

35
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:20,040
The very first time that I... well, you, WE regenerated

36
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:24,640
You're mid-regeneration, aren't you?

37
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:28,920
Your face, it's all over the place - but you're trying to hold it back

38
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:34,400
What do you know of regeneration? Are you a Time Lord?

39
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,920
You know who I am. You must.Hm!

40
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:41,280
Have you come to take the ship back?

41
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:45,800
The ship? You still call it a ship!

42
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:48,960
Oh, dear, what have you done to it?

43
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,200
Nothing.The windows...

44
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,600
I don't remember this. ..they're the wrong size!

45
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:56,240
The colour...I don't remember trying not to change

46
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:58,200
..I'm sure it's changed! Not back then

47
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:02,120
Look at it. It seems to have...expanded!

48
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:04,440
Well, it's all those years of bigger on the inside -

49
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,080
You try sucking your tummy in that long

50
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,960
Why are you trying not to regenerate?

51
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:12,680
I have the courage and the right to live and die as myself

52
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,960
Too late, it's started

53
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:18,200
A few minutes ago, you were weak as a kitten, right?

54
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:22,720
Now you're fine. We're in a state of grace, both of us...

55
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,480
..but it won't last long. We have a choice

56
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:30,640
Either we change and go on - or we die as we are...

57
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:36,720
..but if you, if you die here...

58
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,520
..if your future never happens

59
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:43,640
If you don't do the things that you are supposed to do

60
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,480
The consequences could be...

61
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,920
The snow?The snow?

62
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,400
Look at it!

63
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,240
How extraordinary

64
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,880
Everything's stopped

65
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,280
But why?

66
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:15,840
Maybe it's us. Maybe it's something else...

67
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:21,400
..but somehow, something has gone very wrong with time

68
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,800
Hello?

69
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,720
Sorry

70
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,400
So sorry

71
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:34,640
I don't suppose either of you is a doctor?

72
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,600
You trying to be funny?

73
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,640
EXPLOSIONS

74
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:28,560
There is something I should like to say

75
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,600
That is, there is something I should very much like you to understand

76
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:39,000
I do not have the slightest desire to kill you

77
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:43,200
The only reason I would do so is self-defence

78
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:49,680
However, since you are aware I might kill you in self-defence

79
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,320
There is the strong possibility you will kill me in self-defence

80
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:59,680
Does rather make me wish you understood English

81
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,360
Lass mich einfach hier

82
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,160
Ich will dich nicht toten, bitte geh

83
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,320
Or that I spoke German

84
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,520
War is hell, eh?

85
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,720
SWOOSHING

86
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:37,280
FEMALE VOICE:Timeline error. There is a timeline error

87
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,680
Timeline error. There is a timeline error

88
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,840
Everything's stopped

89
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,680
But why?

90
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:01,480
Maybe it's us. Maybe it's something else...

91
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:05,640
..but somehow, something has gone very wrong with time

92
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:06,880
Hello?

93
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:15,600
Sorry. So sorry

94
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:18,760
I don't suppose either of you is a doctor?

95
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,440
Are you trying to be funny?

96
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:25,840
She's coming! She's coming!

97
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,640
It's her

98
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:33,000
Not human, I think

99
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,360
State your planet of origin and your intentions

100
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:39,600
This is Earth. A level five civilisation

101
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:42,320
And it is protected.It's what?

102
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:46,320
Oh. OK. That doesn't usually work

103
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,800
Protected by whom?

104
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:50,440
Oh, it is early days, isn't it?

105
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:58,960
May I suggest, for your own safety, you step on board my ship?

106
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,720
What ship?

107
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,240
He means, get inside the box

108
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:09,280
A little snug from this angle, but you might be in for a sur...

109
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:15,200
My TARDIS! Look at my TARDIS!

110
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,240
This is impossible!

111
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,720
Have I been burgled?

112
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,760
It's...but it's...

113
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:21,880
Hideous!

114
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:24,600
..bigger on the inside than it is on the outside!

115
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,480
You know, I thought it probably was -

116
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,000
I'm glad it's not just me

117
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:30,960
What is this place?

118
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:35,560
This place is, or ought to be, my TARDIS

119
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,960
Technically, that is your TARDIS

120
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:43,160
It's about 70 feet that way, see?

121
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:45,960
Always remember where you parked, it's going to come up a lot

122
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:50,320
Is this madness? Am I going mad?

123
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,640
Madness?

124
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:54,760
Well, you're an officer from World War I, at the South Pole

125
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:57,120
Being pursued by an alien through frozen time

126
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,040
Madness was never this good

127
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,280
World War I?

128
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:05,680
Judging by the uniform, yes

129
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:10,320
Yes, but what do you mean...one?

130
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,720
Oh, sorry. Spoilers

131
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:18,160
Enough of this! Who are you?Um...

132
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,000
You know who I am. You knew the moment you saw me

133
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,080
I'd say stop being an idiot, but I kind of know what's coming

134
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:30,400
I assure you I do not have the faintest idea who you are!

135
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:33,000
Well, I know who you are

136
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,240
Is anyone going to explain what's going on?

137
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,640
Snap

138
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,920
You are me?

139
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,920
No! No!

140
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:50,000
Yes, yes, I'm very much afraid so

141
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:54,240
Do I become you?

142
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:57,720
Well, there's a few false starts, but you get there in the end

143
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:00,440
But I thought...

144
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:07,200
What? Well. I assumed, I'd get...younger

145
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,760
I am younger!

146
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:13,040
You know, I really don't think I'm completely following

147
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,560
Oh...

148
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:15,720
Oh, dear

149
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:18,640
Oh, you're in shock - let me help you

150
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:21,960
Brandy, get him brandy, do you have any?

151
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,800
I had some somewhere

152
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:24,920
Hang on!

153
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:27,600
Sit down here, my boy, collect your wits

154
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,520
Who are you people?

155
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:33,680
I am the Doctor, and this is my, um...

156
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:36,080
It's complicated, actually - I am also...

157
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,640
..my nurse

158
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,120
Excuse me?

159
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:43,080
I realise that seems a little improbable...

160
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,840
Well, yes... ..because he's a man

161
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:49,560
What?!Older gentlemen, like women, can be put to use

162
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:51,760
You can't... You can't say things like that

163
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,200
Can't I? Says who?

164
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,920
Just about everyone you're going to meet for the rest of your life

165
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,200
Here

166
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,280
Have you had some of this?

167
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:05,600
Well, you know, I may have snuck a glass

168
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,160
At some point in the last 1,500 years -

169
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,880
It's been rock and roll

170
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:15,560
There you are, get this down you. You'll feel a lot better

171
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:17,480
Thank you, yes

172
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,800
I... I don't understand any of this

173
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:23,880
Of course you understand. I am your future self

174
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,360
Are you, indeed?

175
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:28,720
And I suppose this is meant to be my TARDIS?

176
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,040
Our TARDIS

177
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,560
What's wrong with the lights?

178
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,000
It's supposed to be like this

179
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,480
Why?It's atmospheric

180
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:37,360
Atmospheric?

181
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:41,600
This is the flight deck of the most powerful space-time machine

182
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,680
In the known universe, not a restaurant for the French

183
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:48,840
Good Lord, what is that?

184
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:52,240
Oh, look what someone has accidentally left here

185
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:55,400
I say, it's some sort of guitar, isn't it?

186
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,680
Oh, is it yours?

187
00:12:56,680 --> 00:13:00,440
It appears to have been played quite recently

188
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:03,480
It's the only thing here that's been cleaned

189
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:08,080
In fact, this whole place could do with a good dusting

190
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:10,680
Obviously Polly isn't around any more

191
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:15,160
Please, please, please stop saying things like that

192
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:18,000
RUMBLING AND CLATTERING

193
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:45,440
Can't get the engines to start

194
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:49,800
There's some kind of signal blocking the command path

195
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:59,440
FEMALE VOICE:Exit your capsule, the Chamber of the Dead awaits you

196
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:02,240
I'll fix the engines, while you keep her talking

197
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,440
Fields up

198
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,000
Look around you

199
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,560
You stand in the Chamber of the Dead

200
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:41,240
You are known to all here, for you are the Doctor of War

201
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:49,320
The Doctor, yes - but the Doctor of War?

202
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:51,680
Never, ma'am, never

203
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,200
We offer you a gift

204
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:58,160
Return to us the human on your TARDIS

205
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:01,320
And in exchange, you may speak with her again

206
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,840
Speak with whom?

207
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:16,040
Young lady, who are you?

208
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:22,760
Is he here? Is the Doctor here?

209
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,200
Doctor!

210
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:32,520
I knew it!

211
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:33,720
I did, I knew it

212
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:36,880
I knew you couldn't be dead, you don't have the concentration

213
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:42,840
Doctor?

214
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:49,480
What are you doing?

215
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:50,960
Just keep still, please

216
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,000
Bill Potts.Yeah

217
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:58,800
My friend Bill Potts was turned into a Cyberman

218
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:04,520
She gave her life so that people she barely knew could live

219
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,200
So, let's be clear

220
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:10,760
Nobody imitates Bill Potts

221
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:13,000
Nobody mocks Bill Potts

222
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:17,600
Bill Potts is standing right in front of you

223
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,400
How is that even possible?

224
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:25,120
Long story short - I totally pulled

225
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:27,680
You... You did what?

226
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,040
Heather - do you remember, the girl in the puddle?

227
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:34,640
She showed up, she came for me

228
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:37,920
How romantic. Where is she?

229
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,600
Well, she's...

230
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,120
She's...

231
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:49,560
And how did you get here?

232
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:51,960
I... I... I can't...

233
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:54,320
You can't remember. No, I bet you can't

234
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,600
SONIC SCREWDRIVER WHIRS

235
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:59,440
That device, what is it?

236
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,240
A sonic screwdriver

237
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,840
A... A what screwdriver?

238
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,720
It's really a very good job

239
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:09,560
An audio screwdriver?

240
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:14,920
There are only three low-key markers indicating that she's a duplicate

241
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:16,480
I'm not a duplicate!

242
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:20,720
So, who has been stealing the faces of the dead?

243
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:45,120
Time travel technology, obviously

244
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,320
From the far future

245
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,000
I know

246
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,920
Sunglasses?

247
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,280
They're sonic!

248
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:57,480
Indoors?

249
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,240
So, What are you?

250
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:09,800
We are what awaits at the end of every life

251
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:17,280
As every living soul dies, so we will appear

252
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,920
We take from you what we need

253
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:21,400
And return you to the moment of your death

254
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,520
We are...Testimony

255
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:32,560
You come from the distant future?

256
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:34,200
You travel back in time

257
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:38,200
Find people on the exact point of death, and what?

258
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,960
You harvest something from them?

259
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,320
Yes

260
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:43,520
On behalf of the dying

261
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:47,120
What is it that we have that the future needs so badly?

262
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:51,040
And what has any of this to do with a War World I captain

263
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:54,000
Landing at the South Pole, in the wrong decade?

264
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,640
We were returning him to the appointed time

265
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,160
And place of his death

266
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:02,320
An error in the timeline ejected him into the wrong time zone

267
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:06,400
Now his death must proceed as history demands

268
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,880
If I may

269
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,680
Who were you?

270
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:14,160
She wasn't anyone

271
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,400
SONIC SCREWDRIVER WHIRS

272
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,360
She's a computer-generated interface

273
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:20,440
Connected to a multiform, inter-phasing data-bank...

274
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:21,800
Oh, for heaven's sake

275
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:27,200
Will you put that ridiculous buzzing toy away, and look at the woman!

276
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,680
You see?

277
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:33,400
Her face, it's very slightly asymmetrical

278
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:37,320
If it were computer-generated, it wouldn't produce that effect

279
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:41,600
Yes. You're absolutely right. I should have noticed that

280
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,960
Well, it might help if you could see properly!

281
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:49,880
Er...excuse me... Doctor!

282
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,520
Get back inside!

283
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:55,240
I'm not quite sure, but it seemed to me

284
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:58,320
That this young lady's life was being offered

285
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:59,920
In exchange for my own

286
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:05,720
As it happens, I think my number is pretty much up anyway

287
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:08,920
What are you talking about? Doctor, what's he talking about?

288
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:13,520
So, might as well make it count for something, eh?

289
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,240
I should be happy to take your place

290
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:17,200
If that would resolve this situation

291
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,440
GLASS WOMAN:Accepted

292
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:23,720
That is not happening. That's totally not happening

293
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:26,880
Agreed?

294
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,880
Tell me what to do, then

295
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:31,320
Bill Potts would tell me what to do

296
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:32,840
Do what you always do

297
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,360
Serve at the pleasure of the human race

298
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:42,440
Here's what's going to happen

299
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:44,480
First, I'm going to escape!

300
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:45,960
You, with me!

301
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,200
Where are we going?

302
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,960
Escape is not possible

303
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:51,280
It is possible, and it is happening

304
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,520
And I'm taking Bill and the Captain with me

305
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,960
Why are you advertising your intentions?

306
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:58,160
Can't you stop boasting for a moment?

307
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,800
Mr Pastry, too, I could do with a laugh

308
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,840
Escape is not possible

309
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:04,480
Oh, I'm going to do way more than escape

310
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:07,680
I'm going to find out who you are and what you're doing

311
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:09,640
And if I don't like it, I will come back

312
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:12,840
And I will stop you. I will stop all of you!

313
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:15,200
Who the hell do you think you are?

314
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,440
The Doctor

315
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:17,760
I am the Doctor

316
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:21,040
Who you are, I cannot begin to imagine

317
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:25,000
Then let us show you, Doctor. See who you will become

318
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,720
Doctor!Exterminate!

319
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,680
You will be assimilated

320
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:34,800
No. No, that's not a good idea!

321
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,320
They all died

322
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:39,960
The Doctor has walked in blood through all of time and space

323
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,960
The Doctor has many names

324
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,840
..the destroyer of the world...

325
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,760
The Imp of the Pandorica

326
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:50,480
The Shadow of the Valeyard

327
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,440
The Beast of Trenzalore

328
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:54,880
The Butcher of Skull Moon

329
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,440
The Last Tree of Garsennon

330
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,880
The Destroyer of Skaro

331
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:02,440
He is the Doctor of War

332
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,000
What... What was that?

333
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,880
To be fair, they cut out all the jokes

334
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,840
Do what I do when I do it

335
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:18,120
SONIC SCREWDRIVER WHIRS

336
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,200
Jump!

337
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:41,280
They are not escaping

338
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:07,320
Jump!

339
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:20,440
What do we do now?

340
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,560
Run!

341
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:22,880
Where? They've got the TARDIS

342
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:25,440
Yes, that's exactly what they're supposed to think

343
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,880
But they do, though, look!

344
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,720
They've got my TARDIS - over to you, Mary Berry

345
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:31,200
Come on

346
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:38,440
Doctor, is that...another TARDIS?

347
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:41,720
No, no. It's another of the same TARDIS

348
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:50,880
Hang on, the windows are the wrong size!

349
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,120
Inside, quickly!

350
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:58,480
Take off, now! Deep space, anywhere! VWORP

351
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:10,000
I tell you what, these police boxes -

352
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,200
They're ever so good, aren't they?

353
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:15,240
The navigation systems don't function properly

354
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:18,960
I'm unable to program our flight with any accuracy

355
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:25,000
So, my dear, I presume you travel with him

356
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,080
Used to. Kind of miss it

357
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:31,000
Well, he clearly misses you

358
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:35,280
That ship of his is in dire need of a good spring clean

359
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:37,480
No, no, no, stop, stop, stop talking

360
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:39,280
Look, look, look, look at the astral map!

361
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:42,000
Look at all the lovely blinking lights, look at that

362
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,400
He's you!

363
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,880
He is, isn't he? He's you

364
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,520
He's one of your old faces

365
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:53,160
I'm find I'm lagging behind a tiny bit again. You...

366
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:56,400
Not those again, I forbid it!

367
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:01,600
There you go, I was right. Asymmetrical

368
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,000
I said that

369
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,440
Same difference

370
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,960
If her face was based on a human original

371
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,800
Perhaps identifying who that was

372
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:14,480
Will tell us what we need to know about Testimony

373
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:17,000
Why am I wearing these?

374
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,760
Because I love it. Never take those off

375
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:22,160
What's "browser history"?

376
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:27,680
I'm trying to match her face in the TARDIS data bank

377
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:32,400
But there's hardly anything in it yet. We need a bigger database

378
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,920
Possibly the Matrix on Gallifrey

379
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:40,600
No. We need something bigger than the Matrix

380
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:45,360
So basically, we're trying to track the glass lady, yes?

381
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:46,560
Basically

382
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:48,400
A striking looking creature

383
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,280
Quite beautiful, really, isn't she?

384
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:57,280
Yeah, if you like ladies made of glass

385
00:25:57,280 --> 00:26:01,960
Well, aren't all ladies made of glass, in a way?

386
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:04,920
Very good, sir, very good

387
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:07,680
Are we now?

388
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:08,840
Oh, my dear

389
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:11,240
I hope it doesn't offend you to know

390
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:15,000
That I have some experience of the fairer sex

391
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,120
Me too

392
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,520
Good Lord

393
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:21,560
VWORP STOPS

394
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,240
Where are we?

395
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:32,080
But you steered the ship, you piloted her perfectly

396
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:37,160
We are at the very centre of the universe

397
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:40,600
Out there is the most comprehensive database of all life anywhere

398
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,640
There is just one little problem

399
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,400
Which is?

400
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,720
It wants to kill me

401
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:54,240
CHITTERING

402
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:04,440
The Weapon Forges of Villengard

403
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:06,560
Once the nightmare of the seven galaxies

404
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,880
Now home to the dispossessed

405
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:14,280
I say, I think there's something moving over here

406
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:16,120
Step away, please

407
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:18,720
Probably just rats - I'm used to rats

408
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:31,760
Deep breaths, deep breaths. Just breathe, Captain, you'll be fine

409
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:34,200
That creature - it looked familiar

410
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:36,920
It's mutated a bit, but, yes, I should think it did

411
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:39,680
Come along, my dear chap, you'll be fine

412
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:41,320
Get him into the TARDIS

413
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:42,600
What are those things?

414
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:51,320
What we came here for

415
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:53,160
The biggest database in the galaxy

416
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:55,800
They'll settle down in a moment

417
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:59,640
So, do we talk to them?

418
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:01,680
Ask them questions, how does it work?

419
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,280
"We" don't do anything. I do.

420
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:04,600
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no!

421
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,560
You're going to wait in the TARDIS. Why?

422
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:08,920
Because you need to look after the captain

423
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:12,520
You're lying. You think I'm a duplicate, a trick

424
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:14,160
I don't know what I think

425
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:19,720
But if there is the slightest chance that Bill Potts is alive

426
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:21,520
And standing in front of me

427
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:24,240
Then I will not, under any circumstances

428
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,160
Put her life in danger again

429
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:28,680
Seriously?

430
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:31,400
You're looking right at me and you don't even know I'm here

431
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,840
Correct

432
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:36,400
I ask you to respect that, and respect me...

433
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:38,120
You're an arse. Do you know that?

434
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:41,440
You're a... You're a stupid bloody arse

435
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:43,520
..as I have always respected you

436
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:49,440
If I hear any more language like that from you, young lady

437
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:51,880
You're in for a jolly good smacked bottom

438
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,920
Can we just pretend that that never happened?

439
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:02,400
I'm a broad-minded girl -

440
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:06,200
I mean, I know we have this whole professor/student thing going on...

441
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:08,800
Can we never, ever talk about this again?

442
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:10,280
I hope we talk about it loads

443
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:16,880
I hope we spend years laughing about it

444
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:24,760
Come back alive

445
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:25,880
Be here when I do

446
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:37,960
Perhaps another nip of brandy?

447
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:42,120
So that's where it went

448
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:46,200
I'll look after him

449
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:48,760
Good girl, quite right

450
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:52,720
Now, young lady, I don't want to have to repeat myself

451
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,560
I don't think any of us want that

452
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,120
I'll see you both presently

453
00:29:58,920 --> 00:29:59,960
Brandy?

454
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:02,240
Please

455
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:10,120
CHITTERING

456
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:19,520
These creatures - what are they?

457
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:23,480
Old friends of ours - but they've really come out of their shell

458
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:25,480
Out of their shell...

459
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:26,760
Are you all right?

460
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:32,280
I'll be fine in a moment

461
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:33,920
What's the matter?

462
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:36,640
I died a few hours ago - then I refused to regenerate

463
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:39,040
It catches up with you, you know, it's like a big lunch

464
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:40,440
I did exactly the same

465
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:43,680
I know you did - but why?

466
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:47,720
I don't remember this, why are you refusing the regeneration?

467
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,400
Fear

468
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:52,520
I'm afraid. Very, very afraid

469
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:56,120
I don't normally admit that to anyone else

470
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:59,920
Don't worry - technically, you still haven't

471
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:02,720
Why are you?

472
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:10,800
There's something in that tower!

473
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,000
Must be my friend

474
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,200
Why are you calling him your friend?

475
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:24,040
He's got a great big gun, are you suggesting I insult him?

476
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:30,920
Scan me, go on. Scan me

477
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:34,800
Because I've got big news for you

478
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:35,920
I'm dying

479
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:46,160
You see, it's true

480
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:49,920
Dying

481
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:53,920
Now. Be honest with yourself

482
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:55,880
Wouldn't you like to see that up close?

483
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:56,920
RATTLING

484
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:07,840
Come on, up and at 'em, Corporal Jones

485
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:15,480
Funny thing. I wasn't afraid in the crater

486
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:19,000
One doesn't want to die, of course

487
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,760
But one gets in a certain frame of mind

488
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:23,960
One pulls oneself together, and gets on with the matter in hand

489
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:28,920
Big shock for everyone back in Cromer, of course

490
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:30,320
You have family?

491
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:35,960
My wife will miss me, that's perfectly natural...

492
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:39,480
..but she's a solid woman. Remarkably solid

493
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:40,960
And my boys...

494
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:47,040
Well, sons are supposed to move on from their fathers

495
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:48,520
It's the proper way

496
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:51,000
Of course

497
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:54,360
Trouble is, I thought I'd been rescued

498
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:57,200
Felt rather like a miracle, in fact...

499
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:02,960
..but I do have this feeling they're going to put me back

500
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:06,680
Back in that crater in time to die...

501
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:11,880
..and, you see, I'm not ready any more

502
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:19,280
I've lost the idea of it. That's the trouble with hope

503
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:22,480
Makes one awfully frightened

504
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:23,520
HE CHUCKLES

505
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:27,760
I must sound like the most dreadful coward

506
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:40,160
OK. I'd better go up alone

507
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:41,800
I won't hear of it

508
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:47,400
That thing up there won't miss the chance to kill me twice

509
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,800
The paradox would rip the universe apart -

510
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:53,360
And you know how much hard work it is putting it back together again

511
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:55,320
You keep a lookout down here

512
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:57,920
Oh, if you insist

513
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:05,440
BEEPING

514
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:25,560
BEEPING

515
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:46,640
You know what? You're a bit of a legend these days...

516
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:48,200
..but not everyone believes it

517
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:56,120
People don't think that it could happen

518
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,600
That someone like you could turn against your own kind

519
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,240
Because your kind don't do that

520
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:06,360
Out of their shells!

521
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:14,720
Because people don't believe there could be any such thing...

522
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,120
..as a good Dalek

523
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:26,920
I am not a good Dalek. You are a good Dalek

524
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:33,480
Oh! Hello, my dear

525
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:37,200
Now, Rusty, you know that I'm dying...

526
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,560
..and if you don't want me to go off and die somewhere else

527
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:42,880
Where you can't watch, you're going to have to stop shooting at me

528
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:46,320
I agree to your terms

529
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,280
Well, I'm going to need some proof

530
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,320
WHIRRING

531
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:54,880
ELECTRICAL SPARKING

532
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:01,160
You know what?

533
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:03,840
You are the very first Dalek that ever got naked for me

534
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:08,240
You're the first one, yeah? Like, the original version of the Doctor

535
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:11,600
My dear, you should get back to the ship, this place isn't safe

536
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:14,000
You're the one who stole the TARDIS and ran away

537
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,320
The Captain might be needing you

538
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:18,840
The Captain's fine. Why did you do it?

539
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:22,240
Oh, I'm sure your Doctor has explained

540
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:25,600
I'm not even sure he remembers

541
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:29,080
There were many pressing reasons

542
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:31,080
I don't mean what you ran away from -

543
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:32,600
What were you running to?

544
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:37,720
That's rather a good question

545
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:39,960
Questions are kind of my thing

546
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:42,280
How are you with answers?

547
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:46,960
It's been a long time - remember the good old days?

548
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:49,920
When I got miniaturised and I climbed around inside you?

549
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,280
You taught me to hate the Daleks

550
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:58,320
Billions of years ago. What have you been up to since then?

551
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:00,080
Destroying Daleks

552
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:02,400
Yes, all the ones who come here to murder you

553
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,440
Yes, I saw the mess outside

554
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:05,840
Why are you here?

555
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:14,400
As a Dalek, you are linked in to the Dalek hive mind

556
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:19,000
All Daleks are - biggest database I know

557
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:21,800
I'd like to access it

558
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:24,080
Why would I help you?

559
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:32,280
Because...helping me, in any way...

560
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:34,200
..does something wonderful

561
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:40,000
It hurts the Daleks

562
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:45,240
There is good and there is evil

563
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:48,520
I left Gallifrey to answer a question of my own

564
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:53,200
By any analysis, evil should always win

565
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:57,920
Good is not a practical survival strategy -

566
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:04,920
It requires loyalty, self-sacrifice and love

567
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:09,560
So, why does good prevail?

568
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:14,400
What keeps the balance between good and evil in this appalling universe?

569
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:19,640
Is there some kind of logic? Some mysterious force?

570
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:23,200
Perhaps there's just a bloke

571
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:26,480
A "bloke"?

572
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:27,960
Yeah

573
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:31,960
Perhaps there's just some bloke, wandering around

574
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:34,560
Putting everything right when it goes wrong?

575
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:37,800
Well, that would be a nice story, wouldn't it?

576
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:39,040
That would be the best

577
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:42,320
But the real world is not a fairy tale

578
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,320
You dash around the universe

579
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:47,800
Trying to figure out what's holding it all together

580
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:50,120
And you really, really don't know?

581
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:54,000
You know me in the future, do I ever understand?

582
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:57,760
No...

583
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:59,160
I really don't think you do

584
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:04,320
Everyone who's ever met you does

585
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:08,120
You're amazing, Doctor

586
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,320
Never forget that

587
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:13,040
Never, ever

588
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:16,880
Well...that's very kind of you

589
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:19,200
We just needed to understand you, Doctor

590
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:26,720
Professor Helen Clay, University Of New Earth

591
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:29,200
Year five billion and twelve

592
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:33,520
There's footage - can you run it?

593
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:36,800
A spy

594
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,920
A spy in the camp!

595
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:40,680
No, not a spy

596
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:44,360
I'm Bill Potts...

597
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:46,600
..but I'm part of Testimony now

598
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:52,760
The Testimony Foundation combines the resources of time travel

599
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:56,920
With the latest in memory extraction techniques

600
00:39:56,920 --> 00:40:00,120
The near-dead can be lifted momentarily from their time streams

601
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:02,440
Their memories duplicated

602
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:05,520
And then their physical selves returned

603
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:08,760
To the moment of their dissolution, without pain

604
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:11,920
Distress or any recall of the process

605
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:16,360
Now the dead can speak again

606
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:21,760
We can hear the testimony of the past

607
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:23,920
And, channelled through our glass avatars

608
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:26,720
They can walk among us again

609
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:30,320
This is Heaven on New Earth

610
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:34,080
Oh, it's not an evil plan

611
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:38,920
I don't really know what to do when it isn't an evil plan

612
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:41,400
Why did you stop it?

613
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:43,640
Rusty?

614
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:49,080
He didn't stop it. They've frozen time again

615
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:50,400
Who has?

616
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:57,240
Not everything's evil, Doctor

617
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:59,720
You're not the only kind one in the universe

618
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:01,600
I knew you weren't real!

619
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:04,720
Oh, shut up and stop being so stupid - of course I'm real

620
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:08,200
What is anyone supposed to be, except a bunch of memories?

621
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:10,680
These are my memories, so this is me

622
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:15,680
I'm Bill Potts, and I'm back, and so long as I'm here...

623
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:20,080
..what the hell do you mean, you're not going to regenerate?

624
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:28,160
There has to be an end, Bill - for everyone, everywhere

625
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:31,360
What about the Captain?

626
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:37,080
You know he has to die at his allotted point in time and space

627
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:38,640
To correct the error

628
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:42,640
I'm so tired of losing people

629
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:47,760
If the Captain has to die, a request

630
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:50,600
This was our fault

631
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:52,560
How so?

632
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:54,560
Let us take him back

633
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:55,960
How was this our fault?

634
00:41:55,960 --> 00:42:00,200
You and me tried to die twice in the same lifetime

635
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:04,240
Our lives are woven throughout time and space

636
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:08,000
We caused the timeline error that put the Captain in the wrong place

637
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:12,960
We created a whirlpool in time that landed him at our feet

638
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:17,160
But why him? What's so important about one captain?

639
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:23,040
Everybody's important to somebody, somewhere

640
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:26,160
Are you all right?

641
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:31,200
Yes, fine, absolutely. Just thinking

642
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:34,880
I told the wife I'd be home for Christmas

643
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:37,400
Funny how things work out

644
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:51,080
VWORP

645
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:06,080
Thank you

646
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:11,840
Thank you all

647
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:15,360
You've all been most gracious in the unfortunate circumstances

648
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:22,720
I regret, Captain, that the universe generally fails to be a fairy tale

649
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:26,680
When time resumes, you will not remember this

650
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:29,760
A perception filter will also render us invisible

651
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:32,600
Yes

652
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:34,160
One imagines some of those words

653
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:36,480
Were attached to actual meanings of some sort

654
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:40,520
One thing you could possibly do for me, if you were very kind?

655
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:44,040
Oh, anything. Name it

656
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:45,640
My family

657
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:48,640
Perhaps you could look in on them, from time to time?

658
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:52,880
We should be delighted. What's the name?

659
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:59,600
Lethbridge-Stewart. Captain Archibald Hamish Lethbridge-Stewart

660
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:01,040
I shall make it my business

661
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:06,200
You can trust him on that

662
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:10,520
Thank you so much. I believe I am now ready

663
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:33,480
Das ist verruckt. Ich will dir nicht wehtun

664
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:34,840
Cold, isn't it?

665
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:41,440
It's about to get colder, I suppose - for one of us

666
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:54,480
SOLDIERS SING: # Stille Nacht, heilige Nacht

667
00:44:55,920 --> 00:45:01,600
# Alles schlaft, einsam wacht... #

668
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:06,440
I say, is that singing?

669
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:09,360
# ..hochheilige Paar

670
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:15,680
# Holder Knabe im lockigen Haar

671
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:22,720
# Schlaf in himmlischer Ruh!

672
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:25,200
# Schlaf in himmlischer... #

673
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:28,960
Is that...Christmas carols?

674
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:37,280
# Silent night, holy night

675
00:45:38,680 --> 00:45:46,160
# All is calm, all is bright... #

676
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:47,920
ENGLISH AND GERMAN SINGING MERGES

677
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:54,720
You know, I could swear it's coming from both sides

678
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:57,440
If I've got my timings right -

679
00:45:57,440 --> 00:46:02,240
And clearly I have - then we should be right at the beginning

680
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:04,960
I adjusted the time frame, only by a couple of hours

681
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:07,400
Any other day it wouldn't make any difference

682
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:09,400
But this is Christmas 1914

683
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:12,520
And a human miracle is about to happen

684
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:16,000
The Christmas Armistice

685
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:31,400
Wounded man here! HE BLOWS HIS WHISTLE

686
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:35,160
Wounded man here, wounded man!

687
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:41,840
It never happened again. Any war, anywhere...

688
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:45,840
I say, wounded man here, wounded man!

689
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:52,520
..but for one day, one Christmas, a very long time ago...

690
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:58,920
..everyone just put down their weapons, and started to sing

691
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:02,480
Everybody just stopped

692
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:08,200
Everyone was just kind

693
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:10,240
You've saved him!

694
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:12,760
Both of them

695
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:17,440
Never hurts - a couple fewer dead people on the battlefield

696
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:26,280
So that's what it means to be a doctor of war

697
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:29,680
You were right, you know

698
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:32,400
The universe generally fails to be a fairy tale...

699
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:36,880
..but that's where we come in!

700
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:45,960
# For auld lang syne, my dear

701
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:48,960
# For auld lang syne

702
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:53,320
# We'll take a cup of kindness yet

703
00:47:53,320 --> 00:47:57,240
# For auld lang syne

704
00:47:57,240 --> 00:48:01,200
# For auld lang syne, my dear

705
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:05,200
# For auld lang syne

706
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:09,400
# We'll take a cup of kindness yet

707
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:12,800
# For auld lang syne... #

708
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:13,920
I think I'm ready now...

709
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:19,160
..but I should like to know - are you?

710
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:21,800
You'll find out

711
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:24,640
The long way round

712
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:29,720
Whatever you decide - good luck, Doctor

713
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,240
Goodbye, Doctor

714
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:27,040
VWORP

715
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:33,160
Well, then. Here we go!

716
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:37,080
The long way round!

717
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:13,800
You OK?

718
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:22,080
Shall we go for one last stroll, Miss Potts?

719
00:50:32,560 --> 00:50:35,400
Do you know what the hardest thing about knowing you was?

720
00:50:36,840 --> 00:50:39,800
My superior intelligence. My dazzling charisma

721
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:42,960
Oh! My impeccable dress sense

722
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:44,040
Letting you go

723
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:52,320
Letting go of the Doctor is so, so hard

724
00:50:52,320 --> 00:50:54,320
Isn't it?

725
00:50:55,480 --> 00:50:59,400
You see, that's not the sort of thing the real Bill Potts would say

726
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:01,720
I am the real Bill!

727
00:51:01,720 --> 00:51:05,880
A life is just memories - I'm all her memories, so I'm her

728
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:07,240
If you say so

729
00:51:07,240 --> 00:51:10,320
OK. I'm going to prove to you how important memories are

730
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:12,480
I've got a little goodbye present for you

731
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:14,760
Oh, that's nice. Will I have to pretend I like it?

732
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:16,080
Because honestly, that rug...

733
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:17,600
Oh, come here, you

734
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:25,120
Merry Christmas, Doctor

735
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:31,520
Clara!

736
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:35,240
Hello, you stupid old man

737
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:40,600
You're back! You're in my head

738
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:48,200
All my memories...are back

739
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:52,360
And don't go forgetting me again, because...

740
00:51:52,360 --> 00:51:54,120
..quite frankly, that was offensive

741
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:58,840
Memories - important, right?

742
00:51:58,840 --> 00:52:02,720
I know what you're thinking - where is he?

743
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:04,240
Hello, sir!

744
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:05,960
When you're already dying

745
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:08,520
You're entitled to think that your day couldn't get any worse -

746
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:12,080
But here you are. And both of you are here

747
00:52:12,080 --> 00:52:13,480
How does that work?

748
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:16,720
We can be everyone. We are everyone

749
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:19,000
Yeah, it's good this, innit?

750
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,400
Now I'm all made of glass, not just my nipples

751
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:24,040
Yeah - but they got my hair a bit wrong, though, didn't they?

752
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:25,520
You don't have any hair!

753
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:27,440
I have invisible hair

754
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:30,120
Got a suggestion for you, then

755
00:52:30,120 --> 00:52:32,160
Oh, there's a novelty

756
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:33,560
Don't die

757
00:52:33,560 --> 00:52:38,280
Because if you do, I think everybody in the universe might just go cold

758
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:44,040
Can't I ever have peace? Can't I rest?

759
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:50,000
Of course you can

760
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,880
It's your choice

761
00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:53,240
Only yours

762
00:52:54,320 --> 00:52:55,360
We understand

763
00:52:56,360 --> 00:53:02,080
No. No, you don't. You're not even really here

764
00:53:03,720 --> 00:53:06,600
You're just memories held in glass

765
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:10,560
Do you know how many of you I could fill?

766
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:11,920
I would shatter you

767
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:16,360
My testimony would shatter all of you

768
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:20,040
A life this long - do you understand what it is?

769
00:53:20,040 --> 00:53:22,040
It's a battlefield, like this one...

770
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:25,280
..and it's empty

771
00:53:27,320 --> 00:53:30,640
Because everyone else has fallen

772
00:53:35,560 --> 00:53:36,960
Thank you

773
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:40,800
Thank you, both, for everything that you were to me

774
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:48,280
What happens now...

775
00:53:49,320 --> 00:53:52,800
...where I go now...

776
00:53:54,080 --> 00:53:56,240
..it has be alone

777
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:08,360
Cuddle

778
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:26,120
Time to leave the battlefield

779
00:54:33,360 --> 00:54:34,800
VWORP

780
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:41,640
Oh, there it is

781
00:54:41,640 --> 00:54:43,720
The silly old universe

782
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:49,200
The more I save it, the more it needs saving

783
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:50,920
It's a treadmill

784
00:54:54,560 --> 00:54:57,920
Yes, yes, I know. They'll get it all wrong without me

785
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:09,200
I suppose one more lifetime wouldn't kill anyone

786
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:15,440
Well, except me

787
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:25,480
You wait a moment, Doctor

788
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:28,240
Let's get it right

789
00:55:31,320 --> 00:55:33,320
I've got a few things to say to you

790
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:36,120
Basic stuff first

791
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:41,440
Never be cruel, never be cowardly...

792
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:43,400
..and never, ever eat pears!

793
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:46,320
Remember...

794
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:51,120
..hate is always foolish...

795
00:55:51,120 --> 00:55:55,960
..and love is always wise

796
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:08,200
Always try to be nice, but never fail to be kind

797
00:56:08,200 --> 00:56:13,120
Oh, and you mustn't tell anyone your name

798
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:18,280
No-one would understand it, anyway

799
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:23,600
Except...

800
00:56:30,600 --> 00:56:33,000
Except children

801
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:38,160
Children can hear it...

802
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:41,200
..sometimes...

803
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:44,640
If their hearts are in the right place

804
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:47,480
And the stars are, too

805
00:56:49,720 --> 00:56:51,920
Children can hear your name

806
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:52,960
Agh!

807
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:02,200
But nobody else

808
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:06,400
Nobody else, ever

809
00:57:11,480 --> 00:57:12,920
Laugh hard...

810
00:57:14,760 --> 00:57:16,320
..run fast...

811
00:57:18,200 --> 00:57:19,680
..be kind

812
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:27,840
Doctor...

813
00:57:30,920 --> 00:57:32,440
..I let you go

814
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:57,160
VWORP

815
00:58:32,280 --> 00:58:33,560
Oh, brilliant!

816
00:59:05,880 --> 00:59:07,200
SHE SCREAMS
